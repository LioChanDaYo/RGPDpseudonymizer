  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "N/A - validation story, no code. Documentation properly advises passphrase security."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "NFR14 PASS - Manual test (Win11: ~15min) and CI (~10min) are representative. Docker container times (41-42min) inflated by container overhead (no caching, cold downloads)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "NFR3 87.5% success rate exceeds 85% target. Only Ubuntu 20.04 fails (Python 3.8 too old)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Documentation well-organized and comprehensive. Test artifacts properly structured."
