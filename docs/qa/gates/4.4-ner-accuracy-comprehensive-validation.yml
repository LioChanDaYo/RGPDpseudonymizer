  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No sensitive data logged. Tests use synthetic corpus. CI uses least-privilege permissions."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Session-scoped fixtures avoid redundant model loading. CI has 30-min workflow + 300s per-test timeouts."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Division-by-zero protection in metrics. Tests skip gracefully when no category data. xfail for aspirational targets."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (conftest vs test file). Parametrized tests for extensibility. One dead code constant (low severity)."
