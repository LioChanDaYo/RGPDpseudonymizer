status_reason: "All 13 dev-agent tasks (Phases 1-5) complete with atomic commits. 16 files delivered: version bump, release workflow, changelog, 5 community files, README overhaul, MkDocs update, release announcement, metrics tracking. All URLs, versions, and license references consistent. No security concerns. Two low-severity observations noted (changelog placeholder, no tag-version validation) — neither blocking."
