  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test-only story. No production code changes. No secrets committed. CI uses least-privilege permissions."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All NFR targets (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) pass with 80%+ headroom. NLP detection dominates at ~70% of processing time."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cold-start test with NLP model loading now validates true startup path. Monitoring baselines documented with clear methodology."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, deterministic test generation, good documentation. Follows accuracy test patterns from Story 4.4."

    note: "Initial review — 3 findings: TEST-001 (medium, startup cold-start gap), CI-001 (low, unused full_benchmark input), LOGIC-001 (low, empty file logic/comment mismatch)"

    gate: PASS
    note: "Re-review — all 3 findings resolved. Cold-start test added, CI input wired, empty file logic aligned."
