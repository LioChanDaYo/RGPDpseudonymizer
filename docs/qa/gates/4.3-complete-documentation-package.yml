status_reason: "All 9 ACs satisfied with comprehensive documentation. CONCERNS due to encryption terminology inconsistency (README/tech-stack say AES-128-CBC/Fernet while code and new docs correctly say AES-256-SIV) and README still linking to deprecated ALPHA-INSTALL.md."

    finding: "Encryption algorithm description inconsistent: README.md and architecture/3-tech-stack.md say AES-128-CBC (Fernet) while actual code uses AES-256-SIV and new docs (methodology.md, index.md) correctly describe AES-256-SIV"
    suggested_action: "Update README.md (lines 26, 264, 345, 589) and architecture/3-tech-stack.md (line 12) to say AES-256-SIV"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "DOC-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "README.md still links to deprecated ALPHA-INSTALL.md in 2 places (lines 52, 117) despite that file being deprecated with redirect notice in this story"
    suggested_action: "Replace ALPHA-INSTALL.md references with links to docs/installation.md or hosted documentation site"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Task 4.3.12 specifies 'verify all internal documentation links resolve' but test only checks page existence, not cross-reference resolution"
    suggested_action: "mkdocs build --strict with validation.links.not_found: warn provides partial coverage; consider adding explicit link crawl test"

    notes: "Encryption description inconsistency in user-facing docs (README describes weaker AES-128-CBC instead of actual AES-256-SIV). No actual security vulnerability - documentation accuracy issue only."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "MkDocs build fast, no runtime performance impact"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "docs.yaml workflow has proper concurrency control, tests cover all nav pages"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-organized nav hierarchy, comprehensive cross-references, proper exclude_docs configuration"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Align encryption terminology across all docs to AES-256-SIV (matching actual implementation)"
      refs: ["README.md:26", "README.md:264", "README.md:345", "README.md:589", "docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md:12"]
    - action: "Replace deprecated ALPHA-INSTALL.md links in README with installation.md"
      refs: ["README.md:52", "README.md:117"]
  future:
    - action: "Optimize test_documentation_build.py to use session-scoped fixture (avoid 3 redundant MkDocs builds)"
      refs: ["tests/integration/test_documentation_build.py"]
    - action: "Update actions/cache@v3 to v4 in CI workflows"
