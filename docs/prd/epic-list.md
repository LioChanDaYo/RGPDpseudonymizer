# Epic List

### Epic 0: Pre-Sprint Preparation (Week -1 to 0)

**Goal:** Prepare test data and development environment foundation to enable Epic 1 to start without blockers, validating basic NLP library viability before full sprint work begins.

---

### Epic 1: Foundation & NLP Validation (Week 1-4)

**Goal:** Select and validate NLP library against accuracy criteria, establish CI/CD infrastructure, and deliver a working "walking skeleton" CLI command that demonstrates basic end-to-end pseudonymization capability for early validation.

---

### Epic 2: Core Pseudonymization Engine (Week 4-8)

**Goal:** Implement production-quality compositional pseudonymization logic with encrypted mapping tables and audit trails, enabling consistent entity replacement across documents while validating architectural scalability for batch processing.

---

### Epic 3: CLI Polish & Batch Processing (Week 11-13)

**Goal:** Complete the pseudonymization engine with LOCATION/ORG support, deliver production-ready batch processing CLI, and provide comprehensive user documentation for v1.0 MVP launch.

---

### Epic 4: Launch Readiness & LLM Validation (Week 14)

**Goal:** Validate LLM utility preservation with real AI services, complete comprehensive documentation package, achieve all NFR quality thresholds, and prepare for confident v1.0 MVP launch with full user support.

---

### Epic 5: v1.1 — Quick Wins & GDPR Compliance ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-15)

**Goal:** Address deferred alpha/beta feedback, close the GDPR Article 17 compliance gap, improve pseudonym quality and NER accuracy, translate documentation for the French-speaking primary audience, and add PDF/DOCX format support.

---

### Epic 6: v2.0 — Desktop GUI & Broader Accessibility (🚧 IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Expand beyond CLI-only users to the primary growth market — non-technical professionals who need GDPR-compliant pseudonymization but lack command-line comfort — by delivering a cross-platform desktop GUI, standalone executables, French-first internationalization, and WCAG AA accessibility.

**Progress:** Stories 6.1 (UX Architecture), 6.2 (GUI Application Foundation), and 6.3 (Document Processing Workflow) complete. PySide6 desktop app with full single-document pseudonymization pipeline, theming, drag-and-drop, settings, 122 GUI tests.

---

**Timeline: Epics 0-4: 14 weeks (v1.0 MVP). Epic 5: 6-7 weeks (v1.1). Epic 6: 10-14 weeks (v2.0)**
