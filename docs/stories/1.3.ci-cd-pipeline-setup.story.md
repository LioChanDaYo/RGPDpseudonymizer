# Story 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing pipeline running on every commit across multiple platforms,
**so that** I can catch regressions early and ensure cross-platform compatibility throughout development.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** GitHub Actions workflow configured with test matrix: Windows 11, macOS (latest), Ubuntu 22.04.
2. **AC2:** Workflow runs on every push and pull request: install dependencies, run pytest, report coverage.
3. **AC3:** Code quality checks integrated: Black formatting verification, Ruff linting, mypy type checking.
4. **AC4:** Test execution time <5 minutes for unit tests, <15 minutes including integration tests.
5. **AC5:** Failed checks block PR merges (branch protection rules configured).
6. **AC6:** Coverage reporting integrated (codecov or similar), minimum 80% coverage threshold enforced.
7. **AC7:** CI/CD documentation created: workflow description, how to run locally, troubleshooting common failures.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.1 (Expand Test Corpus):**
- Test corpus location: `tests/test_corpus/` with 25 documents and ground truth annotations
- Test structure established: `tests/unit/` directory exists with initial NLP detector tests
- Benchmark script location: `scripts/benchmark_nlp.py` (functional and tested)

**From Story 1.2 (NLP Benchmark):**
- spaCy selected as NLP library (spaCy 3.8.0, fr_core_news_lg model)
- Stanza also installed for comparison (may need both in dev dependencies for benchmarking)
- Large NLP models require download step in CI (~571MB for fr_core_news_lg)
- Existing unit tests: `tests/unit/test_spacy_detector.py`, `tests/unit/test_stanza_detector.py`, `tests/unit/test_benchmark_nlp.py`
- CI must handle model download: `python -m spacy download fr_core_news_lg` (can be slow, needs caching)

**Key Takeaways for CI/CD:**
- NLP model download is CRITICAL CI step that can fail (large file, network issues)
- Model caching across CI runs will significantly improve build speed
- Tests currently exist only in `tests/unit/` - integration tests will be added in Story 1.4+
- Coverage baseline starting from Story 1.2: likely 60-70%, target 70% for Epic 1

pip install gdpr-pseudonymizer
```

**Build Process:** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#package-distribution]
```bash
poetry build
# Output: dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
#         dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

**Publishing:** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#package-distribution]
```bash
poetry publish  # To PyPI (Epic 4 - release workflow)
```

**CI/CD Test Matrix:** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#ci/cd-pipeline]
- Operating Systems: Ubuntu 22.04, macOS (latest), Windows (latest)
- Python Versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Total Configurations: 9 (3 OS × 3 Python versions)

**GitHub Actions Workflow Example:** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#ci/cd-pipeline]
```yaml
name: CI - Test Matrix

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: poetry install
      - name: Run tests
        run: poetry run pytest --cov=gdpr_pseudonymizer
```

---

### CI/CD Performance Requirements

**Test Execution Time Targets:** [Source: Epic 1, Story 1.3 AC4]
- Unit tests: <5 minutes
- Integration tests (when added): <15 minutes total (unit + integration)
- Code quality checks: <2 minutes (Black, Ruff, mypy run fast)

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Cache Poetry dependencies:** Use `actions/cache@v3` to cache `~/.cache/pypoetry` and `~/.local/share/pypoetry`
2. **Cache spaCy models:** Cache `~/.spacy` or model download location to avoid re-downloading 571MB model on every run
3. **Parallel matrix execution:** GitHub Actions runs matrix jobs in parallel (9 jobs run simultaneously if runners available)
4. **Separate quality checks:** Run Black/Ruff/mypy on single OS (ubuntu-latest) instead of full matrix (3x faster)
5. **Conditional workflows:** Code quality workflow can skip if only docs changed (future optimization)

**Common CI Failures to Handle:**
1. **spaCy model download timeout:** 571MB download can fail on slow networks, add retry logic or pre-cached model
2. **Platform-specific path issues:** Windows uses backslashes, macOS/Linux use forward slashes, use `pathlib` everywhere
3. **Poetry dependency resolution:** Lock file conflicts, dependency version incompatibilities
4. **Type checking failures:** mypy strict mode can be challenging initially, may need to relax strictness for Epic 1
5. **Coverage threshold failures:** New code without tests will fail coverage checks

---

### Testing

**Test File Locations:** [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_*.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_*.py` (Story 1.4+)
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/test_*.py` (Epic 2+)

**Testing Frameworks:** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- pytest 7.4+ for test execution
- pytest-cov 4.1+ for coverage measurement
- pytest-mock 3.12+ for mocking
- pytest-benchmark 4.0+ for performance tests

**Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Test Coverage Target:** 90-100% for core business logic

**Example Unit Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip():
    service = EncryptionService("password", os.urandom(32))
    plaintext = "Sensitive Data"

    encrypted = service.encrypt(plaintext)
    assert encrypted != plaintext

    decrypted = service.decrypt(encrypted)
    assert decrypted == plaintext
```

**Integration Test Coverage Target:** 80% of integration paths

**Example Integration Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_reprocess_document_reuses_mappings(test_db, tmp_path):
    """Test FR19: Idempotent processing."""
    orchestrator = create_orchestrator(test_db)

    # First processing
    result1 = orchestrator.process_document("input.txt", "output1.txt")
    assert result1.entities_detected == 2

    # Second processing (same document)
    result2 = orchestrator.process_document("input.txt", "output2.txt")
    assert result2.entities_reused == 2
    assert result2.entities_new == 0
```

**CI-Specific Test Requirements:**

1. **Configuration Validation Tests:**
   - Test pyproject.toml is valid TOML
   - Test all required dependencies are listed
   - Test Python version compatibility

2. **Import Smoke Tests:**
   - Test all project modules can be imported
   - Catch early configuration errors in CI

3. **Platform-Specific Tests:**
   - Test file path handling works on Windows/Mac/Linux
   - Test line ending handling (CRLF vs LF)

4. **Model Loading Tests:**
   - Test spaCy model loads successfully
   - Test model download detection (skip download if already present)

**Test Execution in CI:**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=gdpr_pseudonymizer --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

# Run only unit tests (faster)
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run with verbose output for debugging CI failures
poetry run pytest -v --tb=short
```

**Coverage Reporting:**
- Generate XML report for Codecov: `--cov-report=xml`
- Generate terminal output for CI logs: `--cov-report=term`
- Generate HTML report for local viewing: `--cov-report=html` (creates `htmlcov/` directory)

**Branch Coverage:**
- Enable branch coverage: `pytest --cov-branch`
- Tracks whether both branches of if/else statements are tested
- More rigorous than line coverage alone

6. ✅ Created comprehensive CI/CD documentation ([docs/ci-cd.md](docs/ci-cd.md))
   - Architecture overview
   - Local development commands
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Branch protection configuration guide

**Local Testing Notes:**
- Poetry installed successfully
- Configuration file syntax validated (pyproject.toml TOML parsing)
- Full dependency installation blocked by Python 3.14 incompatibility (project requires 3.9-3.11)
- Missing Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for spaCy compilation (Windows-specific)
- **Impact**: Tests will run properly in GitHub Actions CI with correct Python versions

**Next Steps:**
- Create feature branch and PR to trigger CI workflows
- Verify all 9 matrix configurations pass
- Repository admin to configure branch protection rules
- Repository admin to add Codecov GitHub App
