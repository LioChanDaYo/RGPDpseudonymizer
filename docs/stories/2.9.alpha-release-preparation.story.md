# Story 2.9: Alpha Release Preparation

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** product manager,
**I want** to release an alpha version to 3-5 friendly users after Epic 2,
**so that** I can validate core value proposition and gather early feedback before investing in CLI polish and batch features.

---

## Context

Epic 2 is complete with all core pseudonymization features operational:
- ✅ Pseudonym library system with 3 themed libraries
- ✅ Compositional pseudonymization logic (component-level matching)
- ✅ French name preprocessing (titles + compound names)
- ✅ Encrypted mapping table with passphrase protection
- ✅ Audit logging (GDPR Article 30 compliance)
- ✅ Single-document pseudonymization workflow
- ✅ Batch processing architecture validated (multiprocessing)
- ✅ Critical bug fix (Story 2.8): Pseudonym component collision prevention

**Alpha Goals:**
1. Validate core value proposition with real users
2. Gather feedback on user experience and validation workflow
3. Identify usability issues before Epic 3 (CLI polish)
4. Test installation process on different environments
5. Collect feature requests to inform Epic 3 priorities

**Target Users:**
- 2 academic researchers (IRB compliance use case)
- 2-3 LLM users (ChatGPT document analysis use case)

### Installation Verification Checklist

**Test Environments:**
- [ ] Windows 10/11 + Python 3.9
- [ ] Windows 10/11 + Python 3.10
- [ ] Windows 10/11 + Python 3.11
- [ ] macOS (if available) + Python 3.9-3.11
- [ ] Linux (WSL or VM) + Python 3.9-3.11

**Installation Steps to Test:**
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gdpr-pseudonymizer.git
cd gdpr-pseudonymizer

# 2. Install dependencies
poetry install

poetry run gdpr-pseudo process test.txt
```

**Expected Blockers:**
- Poetry not installed (document in prerequisites)
- Python version mismatch (3.9-3.11 required, 3.12+ not supported)
- spaCy model download fails (network issues, disk space)
- Windows spaCy access violations (known issue - document workaround)

### Alpha Documentation Structure

**ALPHA-INSTALL.md:**
```markdown
# Alpha Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 (NOT 3.12+)
- Poetry 1.7+

[Instructions for Windows, macOS, Linux]

## Step 2: Clone Repository
git clone ...

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
poetry install

## Step 4: Install spaCy Model
poetry run python scripts/install_spacy_model.py

## Step 5: Verify Installation
poetry run gdpr-pseudo --help

## Troubleshooting
- Python 3.12+ not supported: Use 3.9-3.11
- spaCy model download fails: Check network, try manual download
- Windows access violations: Use Linux/macOS or WSL
```

**ALPHA-QUICKSTART.md:**
```markdown
# Alpha Quick Start

## Your First Pseudonymization

1. Create a test document:
echo "Marie Dubois travaille à Paris pour Acme SA." > test.txt

2. Process the document:
poetry run gdpr-pseudo process test.txt

3. Follow validation workflow:
- Review summary (3 entities detected)
- Confirm/reject each entity
- Verify pseudonymized output

4. Check output:
cat test_pseudonymized.txt
# Expected: "Leia Organa travaille à Coruscant pour Rebel Alliance."

## Known Limitations (v0.1.0-alpha)
- French language only
- Text files only (.txt, .md)
- Validation mandatory (no auto mode)
- AI detection: 40-50% accuracy
- Windows: spaCy access violations possible
```

---

### Alpha Testing Protocol Template

**Test Scenario 1: Single Document**
1. Create a 5-page French document with 20-30 entities (names, locations, orgs)
2. Run: `poetry run gdpr-pseudo process document.txt`
3. Validate entities using UI
4. Check pseudonymized output quality
5. Rate experience (1-5): Installation, UI, Output Quality

**Test Scenario 2: Batch Processing**
1. Create 3-5 documents with overlapping entities (e.g., "Marie Dubois" appears in multiple docs)
2. Process each document sequentially
3. Verify "Marie Dubois" receives same pseudonym across all documents
4. Rate consistency and usability

**Test Scenario 3: Reversibility (Optional)**
1. Pseudonymize a document
2. Use mapping table to de-pseudonymize (if feature exists)
3. Verify original text restored

**Feedback Questions:**
1. Installation difficulty (1=easy, 5=very hard)
2. Validation UI usability (1=confusing, 5=intuitive)
3. Output readability (1=poor, 5=excellent)
4. Processing speed (acceptable/too slow)
5. Top 3 missing features
6. Would you use in production? (yes/no/maybe + why)
7. Open feedback (what worked well, what didn't)
