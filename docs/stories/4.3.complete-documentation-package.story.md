# Story 4.3: Complete Documentation Package

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** comprehensive, well-organized documentation,
**so that** I can install, use, and troubleshoot the tool without developer support.

---

## Context

This story addresses NFR13 (Documentation Completeness) and ensures the GDPR Pseudonymizer has a full documentation package ready for public early adopter release. Several documentation artifacts already exist from previous stories (installation guide, usage tutorial, CLI reference); this story completes the remaining gaps and consolidates everything into a hosted, searchable documentation site.

**Why This Matters:**
- Users will not adopt a tool they cannot learn to use independently
- Academic users need methodology documentation for ethics board review
- Developer contributors need API reference for extending the tool
- A hosted documentation site with search is the standard for open-source tools
- Python version support must be aligned across all documentation sources (TD-004)

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 3.5 complete (user documentation guides created: installation.md, tutorial.md, CLI-REFERENCE.md)
- Story 4.1 complete (LLM validation results available for methodology section)
- Story 4.2 complete (installation validation data available, Python 3.12 confirmed working)

---

### Previous Story Insights
**[Source: Story 4.2 Dev Agent Record]**

- Story 4.2 confirmed Python 3.12 works on Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora 39 — relevant for AC9 (TD-004)
- Installation validation report at `docs/installation-validation-report.md` — useful reference for AC1 troubleshooting
- Fedora 39 instructions and passphrase troubleshooting already added to `docs/installation.md`
- Docker Desktop 29.2.0 tested on Windows — Docker instructions available for AC1

**[Source: Story 4.1 Dev Agent Record]**

- LLM validation report at `docs/llm-validation-report.md` — useful for AC3 methodology section
- Anthropic Claude API used for LLM utility testing — results available for methodology writeup

### Tech Stack: Documentation Tooling
**[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]**

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| MkDocs | 1.5+ | Markdown-based documentation site generation |
| mkdocs-material | (latest) | Material Design theme with search |
| GitHub Pages | N/A | Free static hosting for public repos |

**Note:** MkDocs is listed in the architecture tech stack but is **NOT YET INSTALLED**. It needs to be added to `pyproject.toml` as a dev dependency.

### Project Structure: Documentation Files
**[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]**

```
docs/
├── installation.md          # AC1 - exists
├── tutorial.md              # AC2 - exists (was usage.md in arch)
├── CLI-REFERENCE.md         # AC2 - exists
├── methodology.md           # AC3 - NEW
├── faq.md                   # AC4 - NEW
├── troubleshooting.md       # AC5 - NEW
├── api-reference.md         # AC6 - NEW

├── ALPHA-QUICKSTART.md      # Retire → tutorial.md
└── ...
mkdocs.yml                   # AC7 - NEW (project root)
```

### MkDocs Configuration Guidance
**[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]**

- Site name: `GDPR Pseudonymizer`
- Theme: mkdocs-material (Material for MkDocs)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- Enable search plugin (built-in with material theme)
- Nav structure should mirror the documentation hierarchy in Task 4.3.8

### Python Version Alignment (TD-004)
**[Source: Epic 4 PRD - Story 4.3 AC9, Story 4.2 completion notes]**

**IMPORTANT:** Python 3.9 was dropped from support (EOL Oct 2025, security risk). The correct minimum is **>=3.10** per `pyproject.toml`.

Current state across sources (several are **OUTDATED** and need correction):
| Source | Currently States | Correct Value | Action |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| `pyproject.toml` | `>=3.10,<3.14` | Correct | None |
| CI matrix (ci.yaml) | 3.10, 3.11 | Correct | Possibly add 3.12 |
| `docs/architecture/19-coding-standards.md` | 3.9-3.11 | **OUTDATED** | Update to >=3.10 |
| `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md` | 3.9+ | **OUTDATED** | Update to 3.10+ |
| `docs/installation.md` | Likely 3.9-3.11 | **OUTDATED** | Update to >=3.10 |
| `docs/ALPHA-INSTALL.md` | Likely 3.9+ | **OUTDATED** | Update to >=3.10 |

**Action needed:** Update all outdated sources to match `pyproject.toml` (>=3.10). Additionally, verify if 3.12/3.13 should be officially added based on spaCy wheel availability (Story 4.2 confirmed 3.12 works).

### GDPR Compliance References for Methodology
**[Source: PRD, architecture docs]**

Key GDPR articles to reference in methodology document:
- **Article 4(5):** Definition of pseudonymization
- **Article 25:** Data protection by design and by default
- **Article 32:** Security of processing (encryption requirement)
- **Article 89:** Safeguards for research/statistical purposes
- **Recital 26:** Pseudonymized data still personal data (re-identification possible)
- **Recital 28:** Pseudonymization as organizational/technical safeguard

### NLP Benchmark Data for Methodology
**[Source: docs/nlp-benchmark-report.md, docs/hybrid-benchmark-report.md]**

- spaCy fr_core_news_lg: 29.5% F1 (baseline NER)
- Stanza: 11.9% F1 (rejected)
- Hybrid detection (NLP + regex): Improved accuracy documented in `docs/hybrid-benchmark-report.md`
- Mandatory validation mode compensates for NER accuracy gap

### Encryption Details for Methodology
**[Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]**

- Fernet symmetric encryption (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
- PBKDF2 key derivation from user passphrase
- Salt stored per database
- All entity mappings encrypted at rest

### File Locations for New Outputs
**[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]**

- **Methodology:** `docs/methodology.md`
- **FAQ:** `docs/faq.md`
- **Troubleshooting:** `docs/troubleshooting.md`
- **API Reference:** `docs/api-reference.md`
- **MkDocs config:** `mkdocs.yml` (project root)
- **GitHub Pages workflow:** `.github/workflows/docs.yaml`

---

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md, architecture/19-coding-standards.md]**

This story is primarily a **documentation story** with minimal code changes. Testing focuses on:

1. **MkDocs Build Validation:**
   - `poetry run mkdocs build --strict` must complete without errors or warnings
   - All internal links must resolve
   - Search index must generate correctly

2. **CI Integration:**
   - Documentation build added to CI pipeline
   - Broken link detection automated

3. **Python Version Alignment (AC9):**
   - If CI matrix updated, all existing tests must pass on new Python version(s)
   - Run full test suite: `poetry run pytest tests/`

4. **Manual Verification:**
   - Review each documentation page in local MkDocs server (`poetry run mkdocs serve`)
   - Verify search functionality returns relevant results
   - Verify mobile responsiveness of documentation site

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Build documentation site (strict mode catches warnings)
poetry run mkdocs build --strict

# Serve documentation locally for review
poetry run mkdocs serve

# Verify all tests still pass after pyproject.toml changes
poetry run pytest tests/

# Verify code quality
poetry run black --check gdpr_pseudonymizer/ tests/
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run mypy gdpr_pseudonymizer/
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-02-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment

- **Review depth:** Deep (>5 acceptance criteria, 9 ACs total)
- **Story type:** Documentation + tooling (minimal code, high documentation surface area)
- **Auto-escalation triggers:** >5 ACs

### Code Quality Assessment

The documentation deliverables are comprehensive, well-structured, and demonstrate strong attention to user needs. The MkDocs configuration is clean with proper exclusions, the GitHub Actions deployment workflow follows best practices, and the test file covers core documentation build scenarios. The new documentation files (methodology, FAQ, troubleshooting, API reference, index) are thorough, accurate, and well cross-referenced.

**Key strength:** The methodology document is exceptionally well-crafted for academic/ethics board use, with proper citations, BibTeX, and GDPR article mapping.

**Key concern:** An encryption terminology inconsistency was introduced between new docs (correct: AES-256-SIV) and pre-existing docs that were modified in this story (incorrect: AES-128-CBC/Fernet in README).

### Requirements Traceability

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC1: Installation Guide | PASS | `docs/installation.md` - Platform-specific (Win/Mac/Linux/Fedora/Docker), Python/Poetry setup, model download, troubleshooting. Video walkthrough not included (listed as optional nice-to-have). |
| AC2: Usage Tutorial | PASS | `docs/tutorial.md` - 5 tutorials covering single doc, batch, config, themes, mappings. Validation UI walkthrough, tips, best practices. |
| AC3: Methodology | PASS | `docs/methodology.md` - Technical approach, NER benchmarks, hybrid detection, encryption, validation, GDPR compliance matrix, academic citation (BibTeX), references. |
| AC4: FAQ | PASS | `docs/faq.md` - Accuracy, formats, GDPR compliance, alternatives comparison, roadmap with v1.1/v2.0/v3.0. |
| AC5: Troubleshooting | PASS | `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Error reference, installation/passphrase/DB/NLP/validation/platform/performance sections, bug reporting guidance. |
| AC6: API Reference | PASS | `docs/api-reference.md` - All modules documented (core, nlp, pseudonym, data, validation, utils), extension points (custom libraries, custom detectors), code examples. |
| AC7: Documentation Hosted | PASS | `mkdocs.yml` + `.github/workflows/docs.yaml` - Material theme, search, GitHub Pages deployment, proper nav hierarchy. |
| AC8: Effectiveness Validated | PASS | `docs/qa/documentation-effectiveness-baseline.md` - Methodology established, tracking template, post-launch plan. Appropriately notes no beta testers yet. |
| AC9: Python Version Aligned | PASS | pyproject.toml (>=3.10,<3.14), CI matrix (3.10/3.11/3.12), coding-standards (3.10-3.12), tech-stack (3.10+), installation.md, ALPHA-INSTALL.md deprecated with redirect. |

### Refactoring Performed

None. As this is a documentation story, no code refactoring was performed. The findings below are advisory.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Test file follows pytest patterns with type annotations
- Project Structure: ✓ All files placed in correct locations per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Integration tests for documentation build (20 test cases)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 9 ACs satisfied (see traceability above)

### Improvements Checklist

**Must-address (before marking Done):**

- [x] **Fix encryption terminology in README.md**: Lines 26, 264, 345, 589 updated from "AES-128-CBC (Fernet)" to "AES-256-SIV". Also fixed Story 2.4 description in development status section.
- [x] **Fix encryption terminology in `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`**: Line 12 updated from "Fernet, AES-128-CBC with HMAC" to "AES-256-SIV (RFC 5297) deterministic authenticated encryption".
- [x] **Remove deprecated ALPHA-INSTALL.md links from README.md**: Lines 52 and 117 updated to link to `docs/installation.md` instead.

**Nice-to-have (can defer):**

- [x] Add session-scoped fixture in `tests/integration/test_documentation_build.py` - `mkdocs_build` fixture now runs build once, reused by 4 tests. Runtime reduced from ~3 builds to 1.
- [x] Add explicit internal link resolution test - `test_internal_links_no_warnings` asserts no "warning" in MkDocs build stderr (21 tests now, up from 20).
- [x] Update `actions/cache@v3` to `actions/cache@v4` in `ci.yaml` (3 occurrences). `docs.yaml` does not use actions/cache (uses snok/install-poetry instead).
- [x] Clean up residual Python 3.9 references in deprecated `ALPHA-INSTALL.md` body - updated troubleshooting section (3.9-3.11 → 3.10-3.12), dependency conflicts (3.9-3.12 → 3.10-3.12), macOS note (3.9+ → 3.10+).

### Security Review

**CONCERNS**: Encryption algorithm description is inconsistent across documentation:

| Document | States | Correct? |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `gdpr_pseudonymizer/data/encryption.py` | AES-256-SIV (AESSIV from cryptography lib) | **Source of truth** |
| `docs/methodology.md` (new) | AES-256-SIV (RFC 5297) | ✓ Correct |
| `docs/index.md` (new) | AES-256-SIV | ✓ Correct |
| `README.md` (modified) | AES-128-CBC (Fernet) | ✗ **Incorrect** |
| `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md` (modified) | Fernet, AES-128-CBC | ✗ **Incorrect** |

This inconsistency could mislead users about the actual security posture. The README is the most visible document and describes a weaker algorithm than what is actually implemented. Should be corrected before marking Done.

No other security concerns: docs.yaml workflow uses proper permissions, no credential exposure, passphrase guidance is correct across all docs.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues. MkDocs build is fast. Test suite adds ~3 builds (could be optimized to 1 with session fixture). No impact on runtime performance.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All findings are advisory.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/4.3-complete-documentation-package.yml
Risk profile: N/A (documentation story, low inherent risk)
NFR assessment: Inline (see Security Review above)

### Recommended Status

**Changes Required** - See unchecked items above (3 must-address items)

The 3 must-address items are straightforward text corrections (encryption terminology alignment + removing deprecated links from README). Once resolved, this story is ready for Done.
