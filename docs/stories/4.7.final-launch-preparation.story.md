# Story 4.7: Final Launch Preparation

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** product manager,
**I want** all launch materials ready for public early adopter release,
**so that** users can discover, adopt, and successfully use the tool.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** PyPI package published: `gdpr-pseudonymizer` v1.0.0 available via `pip install gdpr-pseudonymizer`.
2. **AC2:** GitHub repository public: README, documentation links, contributing guide, code of conduct, license (open-source).
3. **AC3:** Release announcement prepared: Blog post or article describing project, use cases, key features, getting started.
4. **AC4:** Community channels established: GitHub Discussions or forum for user questions, issue reporting.
5. **AC5:** Outreach plan executed: Post to relevant communities (Reddit r/datascience, r/privacy, academic mailing lists, LinkedIn).
6. **AC6:** Early adopter targets contacted: Direct outreach to identified potential users (researchers, enterprises).
7. **AC7:** Support process documented: How users get help, expected response times, escalation path.
8. **AC8:** Success metrics tracking setup: User count, downloads, GitHub stars, issue volume, community activity.

---

## Context

This is the **final story of Epic 4** and the entire MVP development cycle. All preceding stories (1.1–4.6.1) have been completed, delivering a fully functional, tested, and refactored GDPR pseudonymization CLI tool. This story transitions the project from development to public release.

**Why now:** The codebase is clean (Story 4.6.1 resolved all technical debt), all NFRs are validated (Stories 4.4, 4.5), documentation is complete (Story 4.3), beta feedback is integrated (Story 4.6), and the product is functionally ready for early adopters.

**Nature of this story:** This is a **mixed operational/technical story**. Some tasks are code/configuration changes (version bump, CI workflow, repo files) that a dev agent handles. Other tasks are **manual/operational** (PyPI publishing, repo visibility, outreach, community setup) that the product owner or project lead must execute.

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 4.6.1 complete (Done — 2026-02-10)
- All quality gates green (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
- Documentation site deployed (GitHub Pages — Story 4.3)
- 1077+ tests passing, 86%+ coverage

**Key References:**
- **Epic 4 PRD:** [docs/prd/epic-4-launch-readiness-llm-validation-week-11-13.md](../prd/epic-4-launch-readiness-llm-validation-week-11-13.md)

## Dev Notes

### Story Type

This is a **mixed operational/technical story**. Phases 1–5 are technical tasks the dev agent handles (code changes, file creation, CI workflow). Phase 6 is manual steps the project owner executes after the dev agent completes its work.

### License — RESOLVED: MIT

**Decision (PO validation, 2026-02-11):** The project license is **MIT**.

The prior state had a 3-way conflict:
- `LICENSE` file: GPL-3.0 (incorrect — must be replaced with MIT text in Task 4.7.1)
- `pyproject.toml` line 6: `license = "MIT"` (already correct — no change needed)
- PRD / README: "TBD" / "likely MIT or Apache 2.0"

**Dev agent action:** Replace the `LICENSE` file contents with the MIT license. The `pyproject.toml` `license` field is already `"MIT"` and does not need changing. Update README to reference "MIT License".

### PyPI Package Name

The package name `gdpr-pseudonymizer` is already configured in `pyproject.toml`:
- `name = "gdpr-pseudonymizer"` [Source: pyproject.toml:2]
- CLI entry point: `gdpr-pseudo = "gdpr_pseudonymizer.cli.main:cli_main"` [Source: pyproject.toml:42]
- Package includes: `packages = [{include = "gdpr_pseudonymizer"}]` [Source: pyproject.toml:11]

**Verified (2026-02-11):** The name `gdpr-pseudonymizer` is available on PyPI — no existing package found.

### Existing CI Workflows

Five CI workflows already exist [Source: .github/workflows/]:
- `ci.yaml` — Test matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows × Python 3.10-3.12)
- `code-quality.yaml` — Code quality checks
- `docs.yaml` — MkDocs documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- `accuracy.yaml` — NER accuracy validation
- `performance.yaml` — Performance benchmark tests

The `release.yaml` workflow does **NOT** exist yet and must be created (Task 4.7.2).
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md lists `release.yaml` location; architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14.2 provides `poetry build`/`poetry publish` commands. No workflow template exists in architecture docs — must be authored from scratch.]

**Note:** Architecture Section 14 shows Python 3.9-3.11 in its CI matrix example — this is outdated. The actual `ci.yaml` and `pyproject.toml` use **Python 3.10-3.12** (updated during Story 4.3). The classifiers above reflect the actual tested versions.

### Deployment Architecture Reference

```bash
# Build distribution packages
poetry build
# Output:
# dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
# dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0.tar.gz

# Publishing to PyPI
poetry publish
```
[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14.2]

### pyproject.toml Classifiers to Add

```toml
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "Intended Audience :: Developers",
    "Intended Audience :: Legal Industry",
    "Topic :: Text Processing :: Linguistic",
    "Topic :: Security",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Natural Language :: French",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
```

### Git Workflow for Release

```
Branch naming: feature/launch-preparation or release/v1.0.0
Commit prefix: chore: (for configuration), docs: (for documentation)
Tag: v1.0.0 (triggers release.yaml workflow)
```
[Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md#13.3]

### Placeholder URLs to Fix in README

The README currently contains several placeholder URLs that must be updated:
- `https://github.com/yourusername/RGPDpseudonymizer/discussions` → `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer/discussions`
- `https://github.com/yourusername/RGPDpseudonymizer/issues` → `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer/issues`
- `project-email@example.com` → remove email, replace with GitHub Discussions link and GitHub profile link (no public email — owner decision)

### MkDocs Configuration

MkDocs Material theme is already configured with:
- Site URL: `https://liochandayo.github.io/RGPDpseudonymizer/`
- Repo URL: `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer`
- Sections: Home, Getting Started (Installation, Quick Start), User Guide (CLI Reference, FAQ, Troubleshooting), Methodology, Developer Guide (API Reference)
- Deployment via `.github/workflows/docs.yaml`
[Source: mkdocs.yml]

### Previous Story Insights

**[Source: Story 4.6.1 Dev Agent Record]**
- Codebase fully refactored: 15 atomic commits, 1077+ tests passing, all quality gates green
- Post-refactoring test baseline: 1077 tests (up from 1005 pre-refactoring)
- Windows spaCy segfault: CI skips spaCy tests on Windows (apply same pattern in release.yaml)
- Typer 0.9.x constraint: `Optional[X]` required in CLI files (irrelevant for this story but noted)

**[Source: Story 4.6 Dev Agent Record]**
- Alpha testers were notified during Story 4.6 — can use same channels for v1.0.0 notification
- Entity variant grouping, `--entity-types` filter, lazy imports, ORG library expansion all delivered

**[Source: Story 4.3 — Completion]**
- Documentation package complete: installation.md, tutorial.md, CLI-REFERENCE.md, methodology.md, faq.md, troubleshooting.md, api-reference.md
- MkDocs site deployed to GitHub Pages
- All doc pages accessible at `https://liochandayo.github.io/RGPDpseudonymizer/`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**[Source: [architecture/16-testing-strategy.md](../architecture/16-testing-strategy.md), [architecture/19-coding-standards.md](../architecture/19-coding-standards.md)]**

**This story is primarily non-code changes** (documentation, configuration, CI workflow). Testing focuses on:

1. **Package Build Validation:**
   - `poetry build` succeeds without errors
   - Generated `.whl` contains expected `gdpr_pseudonymizer` package
   - `pip install dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` works in a clean venv

2. **CI Workflow Validation:**
   - `release.yaml` syntax is valid YAML
   - Workflow triggers correctly on `v*` tag (manual verification after merge)

3. **Documentation Build:**
   - `poetry run mkdocs build --strict` succeeds with no warnings/errors
   - All nav links resolve

4. **Regression Suite:**
   - Full test suite must still pass: `poetry run pytest tests/ -v --timeout=120 -p no:benchmark`
   - Code quality: `poetry run black --check gdpr_pseudonymizer/ tests/`
   - Linting: `poetry run ruff check .`
   - Type checking: `poetry run mypy gdpr_pseudonymizer/`
   - Test count >= 1077, coverage >= 86%

**Test Framework:** pytest 7.4+ with pytest-cov, pytest-mock

**No new test files expected.** This story creates no production code changes — only configuration, documentation, and CI workflow files.
