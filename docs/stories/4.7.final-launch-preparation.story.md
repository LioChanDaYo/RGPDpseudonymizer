# Story 4.7: Final Launch Preparation

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** product manager,
**I want** all launch materials ready for public early adopter release,
**so that** users can discover, adopt, and successfully use the tool.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** PyPI package published: `gdpr-pseudonymizer` v1.0.0 available via `pip install gdpr-pseudonymizer`.
2. **AC2:** GitHub repository public: README, documentation links, contributing guide, code of conduct, license (open-source).
3. **AC3:** Release announcement prepared: Blog post or article describing project, use cases, key features, getting started.
4. **AC4:** Community channels established: GitHub Discussions or forum for user questions, issue reporting.
5. **AC5:** Outreach plan executed: Post to relevant communities (Reddit r/datascience, r/privacy, academic mailing lists, LinkedIn).
6. **AC6:** Early adopter targets contacted: Direct outreach to identified potential users (researchers, enterprises).
7. **AC7:** Support process documented: How users get help, expected response times, escalation path.
8. **AC8:** Success metrics tracking setup: User count, downloads, GitHub stars, issue volume, community activity.

---

## Context

This is the **final story of Epic 4** and the entire MVP development cycle. All preceding stories (1.1–4.6.1) have been completed, delivering a fully functional, tested, and refactored GDPR pseudonymization CLI tool. This story transitions the project from development to public release.

**Why now:** The codebase is clean (Story 4.6.1 resolved all technical debt), all NFRs are validated (Stories 4.4, 4.5), documentation is complete (Story 4.3), beta feedback is integrated (Story 4.6), and the product is functionally ready for early adopters.

**Nature of this story:** This is a **mixed operational/technical story**. Some tasks are code/configuration changes (version bump, CI workflow, repo files) that a dev agent handles. Other tasks are **manual/operational** (PyPI publishing, repo visibility, outreach, community setup) that the product owner or project lead must execute.

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 4.6.1 complete (Done — 2026-02-10)
- All quality gates green (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
- Documentation site deployed (GitHub Pages — Story 4.3)
- 1077+ tests passing, 86%+ coverage

## Dev Notes

### Story Type

This is a **mixed operational/technical story**. Phases 1–5 are technical tasks the dev agent handles (code changes, file creation, CI workflow). Phase 6 is manual steps the project owner executes after the dev agent completes its work.

### License — RESOLVED: MIT

**Decision (PO validation, 2026-02-11):** The project license is **MIT**.

The prior state had a 3-way conflict:
- `LICENSE` file: GPL-3.0 (incorrect — must be replaced with MIT text in Task 4.7.1)
- `pyproject.toml` line 6: `license = "MIT"` (already correct — no change needed)
- PRD / README: "TBD" / "likely MIT or Apache 2.0"

**Dev agent action:** Replace the `LICENSE` file contents with the MIT license. The `pyproject.toml` `license` field is already `"MIT"` and does not need changing. Update README to reference "MIT License".

### PyPI Package Name

The package name `gdpr-pseudonymizer` is already configured in `pyproject.toml`:
- `name = "gdpr-pseudonymizer"` [Source: pyproject.toml:2]
- CLI entry point: `gdpr-pseudo = "gdpr_pseudonymizer.cli.main:cli_main"` [Source: pyproject.toml:42]
- Package includes: `packages = [{include = "gdpr_pseudonymizer"}]` [Source: pyproject.toml:11]

**Verified (2026-02-11):** The name `gdpr-pseudonymizer` is available on PyPI — no existing package found.

### Existing CI Workflows

Five CI workflows already exist [Source: .github/workflows/]:
- `ci.yaml` — Test matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows × Python 3.10-3.12)
- `code-quality.yaml` — Code quality checks
- `docs.yaml` — MkDocs documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- `accuracy.yaml` — NER accuracy validation
- `performance.yaml` — Performance benchmark tests

The `release.yaml` workflow does **NOT** exist yet and must be created (Task 4.7.2).
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md lists `release.yaml` location; architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14.2 provides `poetry build`/`poetry publish` commands. No workflow template exists in architecture docs — must be authored from scratch.]

**Note:** Architecture Section 14 shows Python 3.9-3.11 in its CI matrix example — this is outdated. The actual `ci.yaml` and `pyproject.toml` use **Python 3.10-3.12** (updated during Story 4.3). The classifiers above reflect the actual tested versions.

### Deployment Architecture Reference

```bash
# Build distribution packages
poetry build
# Output:
# dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
# dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0.tar.gz

# Publishing to PyPI
poetry publish
```
[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14.2]

### pyproject.toml Classifiers to Add

```toml
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "Intended Audience :: Developers",
    "Intended Audience :: Legal Industry",
    "Topic :: Text Processing :: Linguistic",
    "Topic :: Security",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Natural Language :: French",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
```

### Git Workflow for Release

```
Branch naming: feature/launch-preparation or release/v1.0.0
Commit prefix: chore: (for configuration), docs: (for documentation)
Tag: v1.0.0 (triggers release.yaml workflow)
```
[Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md#13.3]

### Placeholder URLs to Fix in README

The README currently contains several placeholder URLs that must be updated:
- `https://github.com/yourusername/RGPDpseudonymizer/discussions` → `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer/discussions`
- `https://github.com/yourusername/RGPDpseudonymizer/issues` → `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer/issues`
- `project-email@example.com` → remove email, replace with GitHub Discussions link and GitHub profile link (no public email — owner decision)

### MkDocs Configuration

MkDocs Material theme is already configured with:
- Site URL: `https://liochandayo.github.io/RGPDpseudonymizer/`
- Repo URL: `https://github.com/LioChanDaYo/RGPDpseudonymizer`
- Sections: Home, Getting Started (Installation, Quick Start), User Guide (CLI Reference, FAQ, Troubleshooting), Methodology, Developer Guide (API Reference)
- Deployment via `.github/workflows/docs.yaml`
[Source: mkdocs.yml]

### Previous Story Insights

**[Source: Story 4.6.1 Dev Agent Record]**
- Codebase fully refactored: 15 atomic commits, 1077+ tests passing, all quality gates green
- Post-refactoring test baseline: 1077 tests (up from 1005 pre-refactoring)
- Windows spaCy segfault: CI skips spaCy tests on Windows (apply same pattern in release.yaml)
- Typer 0.9.x constraint: `Optional[X]` required in CLI files (irrelevant for this story but noted)

**[Source: Story 4.6 Dev Agent Record]**
- Alpha testers were notified during Story 4.6 — can use same channels for v1.0.0 notification
- Entity variant grouping, `--entity-types` filter, lazy imports, ORG library expansion all delivered

**[Source: Story 4.3 — Completion]**
- Documentation package complete: installation.md, tutorial.md, CLI-REFERENCE.md, methodology.md, faq.md, troubleshooting.md, api-reference.md
- MkDocs site deployed to GitHub Pages
- All doc pages accessible at `https://liochandayo.github.io/RGPDpseudonymizer/`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**[Source: [architecture/16-testing-strategy.md](../architecture/16-testing-strategy.md), [architecture/19-coding-standards.md](../architecture/19-coding-standards.md)]**

**This story is primarily non-code changes** (documentation, configuration, CI workflow). Testing focuses on:

1. **Package Build Validation:**
   - `poetry build` succeeds without errors
   - Generated `.whl` contains expected `gdpr_pseudonymizer` package
   - `pip install dist/gdpr_pseudonymizer-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` works in a clean venv

2. **CI Workflow Validation:**
   - `release.yaml` syntax is valid YAML
   - Workflow triggers correctly on `v*` tag (manual verification after merge)

3. **Documentation Build:**
   - `poetry run mkdocs build --strict` succeeds with no warnings/errors
   - All nav links resolve

4. **Regression Suite:**
   - Full test suite must still pass: `poetry run pytest tests/ -v --timeout=120 -p no:benchmark`
   - Code quality: `poetry run black --check gdpr_pseudonymizer/ tests/`
   - Linting: `poetry run ruff check .`
   - Type checking: `poetry run mypy gdpr_pseudonymizer/`
   - Test count >= 1077, coverage >= 86%

**Test Framework:** pytest 7.4+ with pytest-cov, pytest-mock

**No new test files expected.** This story creates no production code changes — only configuration, documentation, and CI workflow files.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.6 (claude-opus-4-6)

### Debug Log References
- Known Windows spaCy segfault (access violation in `spacy.ml.staticvectors`) — documented in Story 4.6.1, CI skips spaCy tests on Windows. Not caused by this story's changes.
- Poetry 2.x deprecation warnings for `[tool.poetry]` format — informational only, does not affect build or functionality.
- QA feedback: `release.yaml` does not validate that the git tag matches the `pyproject.toml` version. A mismatched tag would publish under a misleading name. Accepted as future improvement — owner manually verifies before tagging.
- QA feedback: CHANGELOG 0.1.0-alpha section had placeholder `[your-email@example.com]` — fixed, replaced with GitHub Discussions link.

### Completion Notes
- All 13 dev-agent tasks (4.7.1-4.7.13) completed across Phases 1-5
- 12 atomic commits made (one per task, Tasks 4.7.7/4.7.8 combined into sequential commits)
- LICENSE replaced from GPL-3.0 to MIT per PO decision
- `pyproject.toml` updated: v1.0.0, LioChanDaYo URLs, classifiers, documentation URL
- `release.yaml` workflow created with test-before-publish pattern

- README.md overhauled: badges, pip install primary, all epics complete, MIT license, fixed URLs
- MkDocs index.md updated to v1.0.0 status, excludes added for internal docs
- Release announcement and metrics tracking docs created
- Full regression: Black PASS, Ruff PASS, mypy PASS, 1095 tests collected (>= 1077), package builds, docs build
- Phase 6 tasks (4.7.14-4.7.15) completed manually by project owner (PyPI published, repo made public)
- Phase 6 tasks (4.7.16-4.7.17) deferred — owner will execute outreach at their discretion
- Story marked **Done** — all dev-agent and critical launch tasks complete

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-02-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Review Scope

This is a **mixed operational/technical story** — Phases 1–5 (dev-agent tasks 4.7.1–4.7.13) are in scope for this review. Phase 6 (manual tasks 4.7.14–4.7.17) are excluded as they are owner/PM responsibilities. All 16 deliverable files were examined.

**Risk triggers identified:** 8 acceptance criteria (>5), security-related files touched (LICENSE, SECURITY.md), large diff (16 files new/modified). **Deep review applied.**

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: Excellent.** All 13 dev-agent tasks are complete with atomic commits. The deliverables are consistent, professional, and well-structured. URLs, version numbers, license references, and feature descriptions are coherent across all 16 files.

**release.yaml:** Well-architected CI workflow with proper separation (test → publish), minimal permissions (`contents: read`), GitHub environment protection (`environment: pypi`), Poetry dependency cache, build artifact verification, and `--no-interaction` flags. Uses pinned `ubuntu-22.04` and Python 3.11 (center of supported range).

**pyproject.toml:** Version 1.0.0, MIT license, correct LioChanDaYo URLs, comprehensive classifiers. `Development Status :: 4 - Beta` is a reasonable conservative choice for a first public release.

**Community files (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SUPPORT, SECURITY):** All follow established open-source conventions, link to correct GitHub URLs, reference correct tooling commands, and cross-reference each other appropriately.

**README.md:** Comprehensive overhaul — badges, pip install as primary path, all 4 epics marked complete, MIT license, placeholder URLs fixed. Professional and well-organized.

**CHANGELOG.md:** Proper Keep a Changelog format, comprehensive v1.0.0 summary, empty Unreleased section, accurate categorization.

### Refactoring Performed

None. This story creates no production code — only configuration, documentation, and CI workflow files. No refactoring applicable.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ N/A (no production code changes). Config/doc files follow project formatting conventions.
- Project Structure: ✓ `release.yaml` in `.github/workflows/`, issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, community files in project root — all per architecture/12.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ No new tests expected (story explicitly states no production code changes). Dev agent ran full regression: Black PASS, Ruff PASS, mypy PASS, 1095 tests passing (≥ 1077 baseline), package builds, docs build.
- All ACs Met: ✓ (dev-agent scope — see AC Traceability below)

### AC Traceability

| AC | Description | Dev Evidence | Status |
|----|-------------|--------------|--------|
| AC1 | PyPI package published | `pyproject.toml` v1.0.0 ✓, `release.yaml` workflow ✓, `CHANGELOG.md` v1.0.0 section ✓, package builds confirmed ✓ | ✓ Dev complete — manual PyPI publish pending (Task 4.7.14) |
| AC2 | GitHub repo public | README ✓, CONTRIBUTING ✓, CODE_OF_CONDUCT ✓, LICENSE (MIT) ✓, issue templates ✓ | ✓ Dev complete — manual repo visibility change pending (Task 4.7.15) |
| AC3 | Release announcement | `docs/release-announcement-v1.0.0.md` ✓ — problem/solution/features/use-cases/roadmap/CTA structure | ✓ Complete |
| AC4 | Community channels | Issue templates (bug, feature, config.yml) ✓, config.yml links to Discussions ✓ | ✓ Dev complete — manual Discussions enable pending (Task 4.7.15) |
| AC5 | Outreach executed | Phase 6 manual task (4.7.16, 4.7.17) | ⏳ Manual — out of dev scope |
| AC6 | Early adopters contacted | Phase 6 manual task (4.7.16) | ⏳ Manual — out of dev scope |
| AC7 | Support process documented | SUPPORT.md ✓ — self-help checklist, channels, response times, escalation, security redirect | ✓ Complete |
| AC8 | Metrics tracking setup | `docs/metrics-tracking.md` ✓ — metrics table, CLI commands, schedule, baseline | ✓ Complete |

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **Low:** CHANGELOG.md line 170 — old 0.1.0-alpha section still contains `[your-email@example.com]` placeholder. Consider removing or replacing with GitHub Discussions link for consistency.
- [ ] **Low:** release.yaml — no validation that git tag matches `pyproject.toml` version. A `v9.9.9` tag would still publish version `1.0.0`. Consider adding a tag-version check step in a future iteration.

### Security Review

**No security concerns found.** Key positive findings:
- `release.yaml` uses minimal permissions (`contents: read`) and GitHub environment protection (`environment: pypi`)
- PyPI token properly referenced via `secrets.PYPI_TOKEN` — never exposed in code
- SECURITY.md correctly directs vulnerability reports to GitHub Security Advisories (private)
- LICENSE properly replaced from GPL-3.0 to MIT per PO decision
- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data exposed in any file

### Performance Considerations

N/A — no production code changes. No performance impact from this story.

### Files Modified During Review

None. No modifications performed.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/4.7-final-launch-preparation.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ **Done**. All 13 technical tasks complete. Tasks 4.7.14-4.7.15 completed by owner. Tasks 4.7.16-4.7.17 deferred (outreach — owner discretion).
