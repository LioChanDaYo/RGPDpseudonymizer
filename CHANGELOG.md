## [Unreleased]

### Refactored
- 🔧 **Codebase Refactoring & Technical Debt Resolution** (Story 4.6.1)
  - **R1**: Decoupled core/CLI layer violation — replaced direct `console.print()` in `DocumentProcessor` with `ProcessingNotifier` callback protocol
  - **R2**: Centralized French patterns — unified `FRENCH_TITLE_PATTERN` and `FRENCH_PREPOSITION_PATTERN` into `utils/french_patterns.py` (eliminated 3x duplication)
  - **R3**: Decomposed `process_document()` god method (~550 lines) into 9 focused sub-methods
  - **R4**: Fixed encapsulation violations — added `reset_preview_state()` and `get_component_mapping()` to `PseudonymManager` ABC
  - **R5**: Factored Union-Find into reusable `UnionFind` class in `entity_grouping.py` (eliminated 3x duplication)
  - **R6**: Extracted shared CLI logic (`parse_entity_type_filter`, `validate_theme`, `ensure_database`) into `cli/validators.py`
  - **R7**: Removed dead code `SimplePseudonymManager` stub class
  - **R8**: Centralized 4 scattered exceptions into `exceptions.py` under `PseudonymizerError` hierarchy
  - **R9**: Harmonized logging — migrated 4 modules from `logging.getLogger()` to `structlog` via `get_logger()`
  - 15 atomic commits, 1077+ tests passing, all quality gates green

### Added
- ✅ **Beta Feedback Integration & Bug Fixes** (Story 4.6)
  - **Entity variant grouping in validation UI** (FB-001): Groups related entity forms (e.g., "Marie Dubois", "Pr. Dubois", "Dubois") into a single validation item. Reduces redundant validation prompts. Shows "Also appears as:" for variant forms.
  - **Selective entity type processing** (FB-003): New `--entity-types` CLI flag for both `process` and `batch` commands. Filter entities by type (e.g., `--entity-types PERSON,LOCATION`). Valid types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORG.
  - **Expanded organization pseudonym library** (FE-006): Neutral theme expanded from 35 to 196 organization entries (101 companies, 50 agencies, 45 institutions). Supports batch processing of 50+ documents without library exhaustion.
  - New backlog item FE-014 for extended coreference resolution (v1.1+)

### Changed
- 🔄 **Faster `--help` display** (FB-007): Refactored CLI to use lazy imports — heavy dependencies (spaCy, torch, SQLAlchemy, cryptography) only loaded when commands are invoked, not during `--help`. Import time reduced ~55%.
- 🔄 **Python 3.13 CI evaluation** (FB-006): Evaluated and deferred — blocked by `thinc` (spaCy ML backend) lacking Python 3.13 wheels. CI matrix remains Python 3.10-3.12.

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Entity variant grouping bridging bug** (FB-001): Fixed Union-Find transitive bridging where a titled surname (e.g., "Mme Durand") could incorrectly merge two different people sharing the same family name (e.g., "M. Olivier Durand" and "Mme Alice Durand"). Ambiguous single-word names are now detected and isolated from Union-Find pairing.
- 🐛 **`--entity-types` filter not applied in batch mode** (FB-003): Fixed `entity_type_filter` not being forwarded to `process_document()` in batch command — affected sequential mode, parallel worker, and parallel orchestrator call sites.
- 🐛 **Deferred items documented**: FB-002 (French docs → FE-010 v1.1), FB-004 (DOCX/PDF → v1.1), FB-005 (GUI → v2.0), Python 3.14 (→ MON-005 monitoring)

---

- ✅ **Performance & Stability Validation** (Story 4.5)
  - NFR validation suite with automated performance benchmarks
  - All NFR targets PASS: NFR1 ~6s (<30s), NFR2 ~5min (<30min), NFR4 ~1GB (<8GB), NFR5 0.56s (<5s), NFR6 <1% (<10%)
  - Monitoring baselines documented: `docs/qa/monitoring-baselines-4.5.md`
  - Stress testing: 100-document batch, 10K+ word documents, concurrent processing

- ✅ **NER Accuracy Comprehensive Validation** (Story 4.4)
  - 22-test automated accuracy validation suite (`tests/accuracy/`)
  - Validates hybrid detection pipeline against 25-document annotated corpus (1,855 entities)
  - Overall metrics: F1=29.74%, Precision=25.25%, Recall=36.17%
  - Per-entity-type breakdown: PERSON F1=33.71%, LOCATION F1=37.05%, ORG F1=9.16%
  - Edge case analysis: 6 categories (compound names, titles, abbreviations, multi-word ORG, diacritics, Last/First order)
  - Confidence score analysis (83.8% entities lack confidence — spaCy limitation)
  - Regression comparison vs Epic 1 baselines (no regression, within 3% tolerance)
  - Quality report: `docs/qa/ner-accuracy-report.md`
  - Monitoring baselines review: `docs/qa/monitoring-baselines-4.4.md` (MON-001, MON-003, MON-004)
  - Dedicated CI workflow: `.github/workflows/accuracy.yaml`
  - NFR8/NFR9 targets documented as aspirational (validation mode is mitigation)
  - Backlog items FE-011/012/013 added for future NLP improvements
- ✅ **LOCATION and ORGANIZATION pseudonym libraries** (Story 3.0)
  - Added themed pseudonyms for LOCATION entities (cities, regions, planets/countries)
  - Added themed pseudonyms for ORGANIZATION entities (companies, agencies, institutions)
  - 80 locations per theme (50 cities, 20 countries/planets, 10 regions)
  - 35 organizations per theme (20 companies, 10 agencies, 5 institutions)
  - Available for all 3 themes: neutral (French), Star Wars, LOTR
  - Collision prevention and 1:1 mapping for LOC/ORG entities
  - Updated exhaustion calculation to include LOC/ORG pools

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-01-30

**Release Status:** Alpha release for early feedback (not production-ready)

**Alpha Testing:** Seeking 3-5 friendly users for feedback on installation, validation UI, and output quality. Testing period: 1 week. See [ALPHA-INSTALL.md](docs/ALPHA-INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

### What's New - Epic 2 Complete

#### Core Pseudonymization Features
- ✅ **Pseudonym library system** with 3 themed libraries (neutral, Star Wars, LOTR)
- ✅ **Compositional pseudonymization logic** with component-level matching
  - "Marie Dubois" → "Leia Organa", "Marie" alone → "Leia"
  - Smart handling of partial name matches
- ✅ **French name preprocessing**
  - Title stripping (Dr., M., Mme.)
  - Compound name handling (Jean-Pierre treated as atomic)
- ✅ **Encrypted mapping table** (AES-128-CBC with passphrase protection)
  - PBKDF2 key derivation with 210K iterations
  - Idempotent processing (same document = same mappings)
- ✅ **Audit logging** (GDPR Article 30 compliance)
  - Structured JSON logs with entity types, actions, timestamps
  - Excludes sensitive data (entity values never logged)
- ✅ **Single-document pseudonymization workflow**
  - End-to-end CLI with validation UI
  - Rich terminal interface with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ **Batch processing architecture** validated
  - Multiprocessing support for parallel document processing
  - Consistent pseudonyms across document sets

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- 🐛 **Story 2.8:** Fixed pseudonym component collision bug
  - Prevented GDPR violation where "Marie" and "Marie Dubois" could map to same pseudonym
  - Ensures strict 1:1 entity-to-pseudonym mapping (GDPR requirement)
  - 18 tests added to prevent regression

#### Validation Workflow (Epic 1)
- ✅ **Rich CLI validation UI** with keyboard shortcuts (`a`/`r`/`?`)
- ✅ **Entity deduplication** (66% time reduction for large documents)
- ✅ **Hybrid detection** (NLP + regex, 35.3% F1 accuracy, +52.2% PERSON detection)
- ✅ **Context display** with entity highlighting
- ✅ **Batch operations** (Accept/Reject All Type)

### Known Limitations

- 🇫🇷 **French language only** - No other languages supported in alpha
- 📝 **Text files only** (.txt, .md) - No PDF, DOCX, or other formats
- ✅ **Validation mandatory** - No automatic mode available (human review required for 100% accuracy)
- 🤖 **AI detection: 40-50% accuracy** - Human validation ensures 100% coverage
- 👤 **PERSON entities only have themed pseudonyms** - LOCATION and ORGANIZATION entities are detected and validated but not pseudonymized with themed names (Epic 3 planned feature - HIGH priority)
- 🪟 **Windows:** spaCy access violations possible (use Linux/macOS/WSL if encountered)
- 🐍 **Python 3.10-3.12 supported** - Python 3.13+ blocked by thinc (spaCy dependency) lacking wheels
